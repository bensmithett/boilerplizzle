# Boilerplizzle

Boilerplizzle is a starting point for small or experimental projects that gives you the tools 
you're used to from bigger projects then gets out of your way.

## What you get
- a local server
- file watching & automatic [Compass](http://coffeescript.org/) & [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) compilation
- a folder structure that doesn't suck
- [h5bp](http://html5boilerplate.com/)'s `index.html` stripped down to the bare essentials
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) & [Lo-Dash](http://lodash.com/)
- [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/)
- TODO: Jasmine + Testem + Travis CI
- TODO: A build task to gift wrap a minified, production-ready copy of your project.

Don't need all of these tools or want others that aren't included? Go nuts!
Boilerplizzle's defaults are designed to be easy to add to, overwrite or delete.

## Super complicated installation instructions

### Get started

A blank canvas is waiting for you at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000),
so stop reading this right now & go do something awesome to `index.html`, `app.coffee` or `screen.sass`!
