# Boilerplizzle

Boilerplizzle is a fast starting point for new projects.

Because deciding to whip up a quick experiment & realising you need to
get the latest HTML5 Boilerplate, jQuery & Modernizr then
set up Compass & CoffeeScript & LiveReload & Jasmine & .gitignore 
& put everything into a nice folder structure & oh god I'm bored I've
already decided to check Twitter instead **SUCKS!**

## Super complicated installation instructions
Make sure you have [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/) installed.

- Clone or download this repo & `cd` into the directory
- `npm install`
- `grunt`

You instantly get the bare minimum you need to build something awesome:
- a server
- a sensible folder structure
- automatic Compass & CoffeeScript compilation
- The [h5bp](http://html5boilerplate.com/) `index.html`
- TODO: jQuery
- TODO: Modernizr
- TODO: Jasmine + Testem + Travis CI

No, you don't get Bootstrap.
