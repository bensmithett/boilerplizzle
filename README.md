# Boilerplizzle

Boilerplizzle is a fast starting point for new projects.

Because deciding to whip up a quick experiment & realising you need to
get the latest HTML5 Boilerplate & strip out the bits you don't need 
then get the latest jQuery & Modernizr then
set up Compass & CoffeeScript & LiveReload & Jasmine & .gitignore 
& put everything into a nice folder structure & oh god I'm bored this is
too much hassle I can't even remember what I was going to build in the
first place oooo is that a cat gif?

## What you get
Boilerplizzle gives you a flexible bare minimum you need to get started with the tools you love using on a bigger projects.
- a static local server
- a sensible folder structure
- automatic Compass & CoffeeScript compilation
- `index.html` from [h5bp](http://html5boilerplate.com/) 
- TODO: jQuery
- TODO: Modernizr
- TODO: Jasmine + Testem + Travis CI
- TODO: A build task to gift wrap a minified, production-ready copy of your project.

No, you don't get Bootstrap.
